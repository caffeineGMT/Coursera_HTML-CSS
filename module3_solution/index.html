          This is the traditional profile for skis and snowboards. Camber is a slight upward curve in the middle
          of a
          ski or board, with the contact points - where an unweighted ski or board contacts the snow - close to
          the
          ends. Camber requires more precise turn initiation and offers superb precision with plenty of power on
          groomed terrain and harder snow. The rider's weight puts an even and concentrated pressure on the edge
          from
          tip to tail, resulting in increased edgehold and better "pop." Racers and high level park riders often
          prefer camber. Cambered skis are great for skiers riding the hard snow of Vermont and the East Coast, as
          well as those look for a more traditional feel.
