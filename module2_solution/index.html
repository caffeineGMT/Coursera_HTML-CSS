            <h4>camber</h4>
            <p>
                This is the traditional profile for skis and snowboards. Camber is a slight upward curve in the middle
                of a
                ski or board, with the contact points - where an unweighted ski or board contacts the snow - close to
                the
                ends. Camber requires more precise turn initiation and offers superb precision with plenty of power on
                groomed terrain and harder snow. The rider's weight puts an even and concentrated pressure on the edge
                from
                tip to tail, resulting in increased edgehold and better "pop." Racers and high level park riders often
                prefer camber. Cambered skis are great for skiers riding the hard snow of Vermont and the East Coast, as
                well as those look for a more traditional feel.

            <h4>rocker</h4>
            <p>
                Rocker is camber turned upside down. All skis and
                snowboards, rockered or cambered, when put on edge and weighted in a turn achieve reverse-camber.
                Cambered skis and boards produce more pressure on the snow at the tip and tail since they have to flex
                further to
                achieve this curve. Rocker skis and
                snowboards offer superior float in the soft snow and increased ease of turn initiation with less chance
                of
                "catching" an edge. This is great for skiing deep powder in areas like British Columbia and ski areas in
                Colorado. As skis in general get wider, rocker helps keep the new shapes maneuverable for a wider range
                of
                skiers. Wide ski and board shapes designed primarily for powder are often rockered.

            <h4>hybrid</h4>
            <p>
                Considering the drawbacks of both camber and rocker profiles, the snowboard manufacturers started
                pondering upon giving the best of both worlds to snowboarders.
                This resulted in hybrid snowboards in which camber is under the foot to ensure superb edge hold and
                rocker is at the two contact points for effortless floating on powder and a more playful ride.
                Like the name suggests, hybrid profiles are a mix of camber, flat and rocker. There are heaps of
                different
                combinations of this employed by snowboard manufacturers. The most common hybrids are hybrid camber,
                hybrid rocker and flat-to-rocker.
