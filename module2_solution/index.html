    <section class="col-1">camber
        <p>
            This is the traditional profile for skis and snowboards. Camber is a slight upward curve in the middle of a
            ski or board, with the contact points - where an unweighted ski or board contacts the snow - close to the
            ends. Camber requires more precise turn initiation and offers superb precision with plenty of power on
            groomed terrain and harder snow. The rider's weight puts an even and concentrated pressure on the edge from
            tip to tail, resulting in increased edgehold and better "pop." Racers and high level park riders often
            prefer camber. Cambered skis are great for skiers riding the hard snow of Vermont and the East Coast, as
            well as those look for a more traditional feel.

    <section class="col-2">rocker
        <p>
            Rocker (also called reverse-camber) is just as it sounds â€“ camber turned upside down. All skis and
            snowboards, rockered or cambered, when put on edge and weighted in a turn achieve reverse-camber. Cambered
            skis and boards produce more pressure on the snow at the tip and tail since they have to flex further to
            achieve this curve. The term rocker is borrowed from watersports where rocker is common. Rocker skis and
            snowboards offer superior float in the soft snow and increased ease of turn initiation with less chance of
            "catching" an edge. This is great for skiing deep powder in areas like British Columbia and ski areas in
            Colorado. As skis in general get wider, rocker helps keep the new shapes maneuverable for a wider range of
            skiers. Wide ski and board shapes designed primarily for powder are often rockered.

    <section class="col-3">hybrid
        <p>
            Like the name suggests, hybrid profiles are a mix of camber, flat and rocker. There are heaps of different
            combinations of this employed by snowboard manufacturers. The most common hybrids are rocker/camber/rocker
            (hybrid camber), camber/rocker/camber (hybrid rocker) and rocker/flat/rocker (flat-to-rocker)
